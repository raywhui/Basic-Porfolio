		<p>Hi! My name is Raymond Hui and this is my online portfolio. I am a Junior Web Developer currently studying at the Coding Bootcamp at the University of California, Berkeley. This portfolio will demonstrate my working knowledge of both Front-End and Back-End web development through the my use of HTML, CSS, and GitHub. </p>

		<p>In my previous career, I was in the biomedical and health/fitness industry after having studied Exercise Science at the University of California, Davis. I had the privilege of working with individuals to improve their health and wellness and helping them to achieve their fitness goals and aspirations.</p>
